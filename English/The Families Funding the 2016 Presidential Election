Just 158 families have provided nearly half of the early money for efforts to capture the White House.
They are overwhelmingly white, rich, older and male, in a nation that is being remade by the young, by women, and by black and brown voters. Across a sprawling country, they reside in an archipelago of wealth, exclusive neighborhoods dotting a handful of cities and towns. And in an economy that has minted billionaires in a dizzying array of industries, most made their fortunes in just two: finance and energy.
Now they are deploying their vast wealth in the political arena, providing almost half of all the seed money raised to support Democratic and Republican presidential candidates. Just 158 families, along with companies they own or control, contributed $176 million in the first phase of the campaign, a New York Times investigation found. Not since before Watergate have so few people and businesses provided so much early money in a campaign, most of it through channels legalized by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision five years ago.
These donors’ fortunes reflect the shifting composition of the country’s economic elite. Relatively few work in the traditional ranks of corporate America, or hail from dynasties of inherited wealth. Most built their own businesses, parlaying talent and an appetite for risk into huge wealth: They founded hedge funds in New York, bought up undervalued oil leases in Texas, made blockbusters in Hollywood. More than a dozen of the elite donors were born outside the United States, immigrating from countries like Cuba, the old Soviet Union, Pakistan, India and Israel.
But regardless of industry, the families investing the most in presidential politics overwhelmingly lean right, contributing tens of millions of dollars to support Republican candidates who have pledged to pare regulations; cut taxes on income, capital gains and inheritances; and shrink entitlement programs. While such measures would help protect their own wealth, the donors describe their embrace of them more broadly, as the surest means of promoting economic growth and preserving a system that would allow others to prosper, too.
Mostly Backing Republicans
“It’s a lot of families around the country who are self-made who feel like over-regulation puts these burdens on smaller companies,” said Doug Deason, a Dallas investor whose family put $5 million behind Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and now, after Mr. Perry’s exit, is being courted by many of the remaining candidates. “They’ve done well. They want to see other people do well.”
In marshaling their financial resources chiefly behind Republican candidates, the donors are also serving as a kind of financial check on demographic forces that have been nudging the electorate toward support for the Democratic Party and its economic policies. Two-thirds of Americans support higher taxes on those earning $1 million or more a year, according to a June New York Times/CBS News poll, while six in 10 favor more government intervention to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly seven in 10 favor preserving Social Security and Medicare benefits as they are.
Republican candidates have struggled to improve their standing with Hispanic voters, women and African-Americans. But as the campaign unfolds, Republicans are far outpacing Democrats in exploiting the world of “super PACs,” which, unlike candidates’ own campaigns, can raise unlimited sums from any donor, and which have so far amassed the bulk of the money in the election.
The 158 families each contributed $250,000 or more in the campaign through June 30, according to the most recent available Federal Election Commission filings and other data, while an additional 200 families gave more than $100,000. Together, the two groups contributed well over half the money in the presidential election -- the vast majority of it supporting Republicans.
“The campaign finance system is now a countervailing force to the way the actual voters of the country are evolving and the policies they want,” said Ruy Teixeira, a political and demographic expert at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.
Like most of the ultrawealthy, the new donor elite is deeply private. Very few of those contacted were willing to speak about their contributions or their political views. Many donations were made from business addresses or post office boxes, or wound through limited liability corporations or trusts, exploiting the new avenues opened up by Citizens United, which gave corporate entities far more leeway to spend money on behalf of candidates. Some contributors, for reasons of privacy or tax planning, are not listed as the owners of the homes where they live, further obscuring the family and social ties that bind them.
But interviews and a review of hundreds of public documents — voter registrations, business records, F.E.C. data and more — reveal a class apart, distant from much of America while geographically, socially and economically intermingling among themselves. Nearly all the neighborhoods where they live would fit within the city limits of New Orleans. But minorities make up less than one-fifth of those neighborhoods’ collective population, and virtually no one is black. Their residents make four and a half times the salary of the average American, and are twice as likely to be college educated.
Most of the families are clustered around just nine cities. Many are neighbors, living near one another in neighborhoods like Bel Air and Brentwood in Los Angeles; River Oaks, a Houston community popular with energy executives; or Indian Creek Village, a private island near Miami that has a private security force and just 35 homes lining an 18-hole golf course.
Sometimes, across party lines, they are patrons of the same symphonies, art museums or at-risk youth programs. They are business partners, in-laws and, on occasion, even poker buddies.

Krohn Family
Donated $250,000
More than 50 members of these families have made the Forbes 400 list of the country’s top billionaires, marking a scale of wealth against which even a million-dollar political contribution can seem relatively small. The Chicago hedge fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, for example, earns about $68.5 million a month after taxes, according to court filings made by his wife in their divorce. He has given a total of $300,000 to groups backing Republican presidential candidates. That is a huge sum on its face, yet is the equivalent of only $21.17 for a typical American household, according to Congressional Budget Office data on after-tax income.
The donor families’ wealth reflects, in part, the vast growth of the financial-services sector and the boom in oil and gas, which have helped transform the American economy in recent decades. They are also the beneficiaries of political and economic forces that are driving widening inequality: As the share of national wealth and income going to the middle class has shrunk, these families are among those whose share has grown.
Mainly in Finance and Energy
The accumulation of wealth has been particularly rapid at the elite levels of Wall Street, where financiers who once managed other people’s capital now, increasingly, own it themselves. Since 1979, according to one study, the one- tenth of 1 percent of American taxpayers who work in finance have roughly quintupled their share of the country’s income. Sixty-four of the families made their wealth in finance, the largest single faction among the super- donors of 2016.
But instead of working their way up to the executive suite at Goldman Sachs or Exxon, most of these donors set out on their own, establishing privately held firms controlled individually or with partners. In finance, they started hedge funds, or formed private equity and venture capital firms, benefiting from favorable tax treatment of debt and capital gains, and more recently from a rising stock market and low interest rates. In energy, some were latter-day wildcatters, early to capitalize on the new drilling technologies and high energy prices that made it economical to exploit shale formations in North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. Others made fortunes supplying those wildcatters with pipelines, trucks and equipment for “fracking.”
In both energy and finance, their businesses, when successful, could throw off enormous amounts of cash — unlike industries in which wealth might have been tied up in investments. Those without shareholders or boards of directors have had unusual freedom to indulge their political passions. Together, the two industries accounted for well over half of the cash contributed by the top 158 families.
Tend to Be Self-Made
“When I look at these families, these are highly successful people, they’re used to moving mountains, and they love to beat the conventional wisdom,” said David McCurdy, a former Oklahoma congressman who is now president of the American Gas Association.
Indeed, while blue-chip corporations largely shy away from super PACs, wary of negative publicity about unlimited campaign spending, these families have poured millions of dollars into such efforts.
Some are even betting on candidates shunned by their party’s traditional donor establishment. The three families who have provided the largest donations in the campaign to date — the Wilks family of Texas, which made billions providing trucks and equipment in the shale fields; the Mercers of New York, headed by the hedge fund investor Robert Mercer; and Toby Neugebauer, a Texas- born private equity investor — have backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a socially conservative Tea Party firebrand disdained by Republican leaders.
“Making a big bet on something before anyone else really grasps it. That is what success has in common in energy and in equities,” said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group with ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch.
A number of the families are tied to networks of ideological donors who, on the left and the right alike, have sought to fundamentally reshape their own political parties. More than a dozen donors or members of their families have been involved with the twice-yearly seminars hosted by the Kochs, whose organizations have pressed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups to eliminate the Export-Import Bank. They include Mr. Deason and his wife; the brokerage pioneer Charles Schwab, whose wife, Helen, is among the donors; and Karen Buchwald Wright, whose family company makes compressors used to extract and transport natural gas.
“Most of the people at the Koch seminars are entrepreneurs who have built it from the ground up — they built it themselves,” said Mr. Deason, who said he supported eliminating corporate subsidies and welfare, including those that benefit his own investments.
Another group of the families, including the hedge fund investor George Soros and his son Jonathan, have ties to the Democracy Alliance, a network of liberal donors who have pushed Democrats to move aggressively on climate change legislation and progressive taxation. Those donors, many of them from Hollywood or Wall Street, have put millions of dollars behind Hillary Rodham Clinton.
The families who give do so, to some extent, because of personal, regional and professional ties to the candidates. Jeb Bush’s father made money in the oil business, while Mr. Bush himself earned millions of dollars on Wall Street. Some of the candidates most popular among ultrawealthy donors have also served in elected office in Florida and Texas, two states that are home to many of the affluent families on the list.

But the giving, more broadly, reflects the political stakes this year for the families and businesses that have moved most aggressively to take advantage of Citizens United, particularly in the energy and finance industries.
The Obama administration, Democrats in Congress and even Mr. Bush have argued for tax and regulatory shifts that could subject many venture capital and private equity firms to higher levels of corporate or investment taxation. Hedge funds, which historically were lightly regulated, are bound by new rules with the Dodd-Frank regulations, which several Republican candidates have pledged to roll back and which Mrs. Clinton has pledged to defend.
And while the shale boom has generated new fortunes, it has also produced a glut of oil that is now driving down prices. Most in the industry favor lifting the 40-year-old ban on exporting oil, which would give domestic producers access to new customers overseas, and approval of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline.
“They don’t want anything from the government except that they’d like to export oil, and most of them want the Keystone pipeline,” T. Boone Pickens, the investor and natural gas advocate, said about his colleagues in the energy business.
“If you look at the oil and gas industry, it has done wonders for the country. They paid a lot of taxes, and people still attack you,” said Mr. Pickens, who has donated $125,000 to groups supporting Mr. Bush or Carly Fiorina. “They’re entrepreneurs, and they have opinions about everything.”


2016美国大选背后的家族

158个家庭捐出了竞选经费的一半，他们是谁？为什么要这么做？
       在一个正在被年轻、女性、有色人种的选民所改变的国家里，他们绝大多数都是富有、年老的男性白人，在这个庞大的国家里，他们住在富有而与世隔离的街区，如同点缀在无数城镇海洋中的孤岛。在令人眼花缭乱的制造亿万富翁的产业中，他们多半来自两个行业：金融和能源。
        他们把自己巨大的财富投入到政治领域，提供了几乎一半的种子资金来支持民主党和共和党的总统候选人。时代杂志的一项调查发现，区区158个家庭及其拥有或控股的公司就在选战的第一阶段捐出了1.76亿美元。从水门事件之前开始，就已经没人会这么早投入巨资支持竞选。这些家庭的大部分捐款都是通过由美国最高法院的公民联合会议在五年前决议合法化的渠道捐出的。
        这些捐款人的财富反映出美国经济精英组成的变化，很少人来自传统的企业、或者继承。相反，大部分人都建立了自己的生意，用才能和承担风险来获得巨大的财富：他们在纽约建立了对冲基金，在德州购买被低估的石油开采权，在好莱坞拍大片，其中超过12位以上的人出生在美国之外，从古巴、前苏联、巴基斯坦、印度和以色列等国移民到美国。
       但是无论他们从事何种行业，投入总统竞选资金最多的家庭在政治上几乎都是右倾的，投入上千万美元支持推动削减政策的共和党的候选人，比如降低所得税、投资收益税和遗产税，缩减公共开支等，虽然这些都能够帮助他们保护自己的财产，但是捐款人也表示这可以保证经济成长、让其他人也能致富。
多半支持共和党
       “许多家庭都是白手起家，他们觉得过度监管会加重小公司的负担，”道格迪森说，他是达拉斯的投资人，他的家庭投入了5百万美元支持德州州长里克佩里，佩里退出后，其他的候选人也在寻求他的支持，“他们干得很好，所以希望看到其他人也能有机会。”
        除了为共和党注资，这些捐款人也透过金融监察去接近支持民主党及其经济政策的选民，根据时代杂志／哥伦比亚广播公司六月进行的一项投票，三分之二的美国人支持提高年收入一百万美元及以上的家庭的税率，十分之六的人希望政府能够进行更多的干预，以缩小贫富差距，根据皮尤研究中心的说法，接近十分之七希望政府能够维持社保和医保。
        共和党候选人很难提高在西班牙裔、女性、非洲裔美国选民心目中的地位，但是随着选战的展开，他们在开发利用“超级政治委员会”方面远远超过民主党人，跟候选人自己的竞选办公室不同，超级政治委员会为任何候选人筹集的金额都是没有限制的，到目前为止已经为竞选积累了大量资金。
        6月30日，根据联邦选举委员会披露的最新信息和其他数据，这158个家庭已经各自捐出了25万美元以上，另外有200个家庭都捐了10万美元以上，这两组人的捐款加在一起，就占了竞选资金的一半多——绝大部分用于支持共和党。
       “这个系统正在阻碍这个国家实际选民的进步，也使他们无法得到自己想要的政策，”左倾的美国进步中心的政治和人口专家路易泰克谢拉说。
        跟大部分的巨富一样，这些新的精英们都极其注重隐私，极少数能够接触到的也不愿意谈论捐款或自己的政治观点，许多捐款是使用商业地址或公共邮箱，要么就是通过有限责任公司或信托基金，公民联合会所开辟的新渠道给了公司极大的自由支持候选人，一些捐款人为了保护隐私或税务原因，并没有登记为自己所住的房子的所有人，进一步隐蔽了他们的家庭或社会关系。
       但是查阅数百份公共文件——选民登记、商业纪录、F.E.C.数据及其他——还是可以揭示出一个在地理上、社会上、经济上自成一体的远离大部分美国人的阶层，他们住的街区差不多跟新奥尔良一样大，但是少数族裔只占不到总人口的五分之一，而且没有黑人，他们的薪水超过美国平均水平4.5倍，大学入学率是平均水平的2倍。
        这些家庭的住地大部分被九个城市所环绕，许多人是邻居，住在彼此相邻的街区，比如洛杉矶的贝莱尔和布伦特伍德；能源大鳄们青睐的一个休斯顿社区橡树；，或者迈阿密附近一个私人小岛印第安溪流村，他们拥有自己的私人保安武装，35个家庭，附带一个18洞的高尔夫球场。
       有时候，除去党派之见，他们会去听同样的交响乐，去同样的艺术博物馆，参加同一个高危青年项目，他们是商业伙伴、亲家，偶尔还是牌友。
彼此为邻

劳家庭，捐50万美元
萨罗费姆家庭，捐53万美元
弗罗瑞斯家庭，捐25万美元
橡树河乡村俱乐部
迈克耐尔家庭，捐2百万美元
安瑟瑞家庭，捐2百万美元
金德家庭，捐2百万美元
克鲁赫家庭，捐25万美元
       这些家庭中有50多个人都在福布斯400的美国顶级富豪榜上，这让他们即使捐出百万美元也微不足道。以芝加哥对冲基金的亿万富豪肯尼思 C. 葛瑞芬为例，根据他妻子在法庭上签署的离婚协议，他一个月税后收入6千8百万美元。他捐了30万美元给共和党候选人，表面看起来这是个很大的数字，但是按照国会预算办公室的税后收入数据，这只相当于普通美国家庭的21.17美元。
        捐款人的家庭财富部分反映出金融服务业和油气行业的巨大发展，这两个行业在最近几十年重塑了美国经济，当然他们也受益于造成了贫富差距扩大的政治和经济力量，随着国家流入中产阶级的福利和工资的缩减，这些家庭所占的份额却在扩大。
主要从事金融和能源业
        华尔街精英阶层的财富积累尤其迅速，金融家们从前管理别人的资本，现在以日益增长的速度拥有了自己的财产，根据一项研究，1979年以来，1％的从事金融业的美国纳税人中的十分之一的人，其收入占全国总收入的份额增加了五倍，2016年的超级捐款人致富最大途径就是金融，64％的家庭靠金融业致富。
       但是绝大部分捐款人并不谋取高盛或艾克森美孚石油之类公司的高层职位，他们一般都会建立自己的生意，私人控股或合伙公司。在金融业，他们开设对冲基金，或私募资本公司，从债务或资本收益的税收优惠中获利，新近又获益于上涨的股市和低利率；在能源业，一些人是新兴的投机分子，最早投资于新的钻井技术，能源价格的高企使得开采北达科他、俄亥俄、宾夕法尼亚和德州的页岩油变得有利可图，其他人则通过给这些投机分子提供设备而发财，比如输油管、卡车和“水压法”设备。
        无论是在金融业还是能源业，一旦成功都能让他们一掷千金——因为他们不必像传统工业那样，可能得把钱用于再投资，这些没有股东也没有董事会的人有着非同寻常的自由可以沉浸于自己的政治激情中，这两大行业加在一起捐出了158个家庭捐款总额的一半以上。
倾向于自力更生
       “在我看来，这些家庭，他们都是非常成功的人士，他们习惯于不可思议的方式，喜欢痛击传统智慧，”前俄克拉荷马参议员，现任美国天然气协会主席的大卫迈克库迪说。
        的确，在许多蓝筹公司因为担心公众对无限制的竞选经费会产生负面的舆论，极力回避超级政治委员会的时候，这些家庭却投入了数百万美元。
       有人甚至把注押在被自己党派传统捐赠者刻意回避的候选人身上，至今为止提供了最多捐款的三个家庭——德州的维尔克，在页岩油开采方面提供了数十亿美元的卡车和设备，纽约的默瑟，以对冲基金投资者罗伯特默瑟为首，还有托比纽吉鲍尔，声誉德州的私人股权投资者——都支持过为共和党领导所不屑的保守的茶党政治煽动家德州的泰得克鲁兹。
       “在还没有人明白的时候下个大注，这就是能源业和股市成功的一般法则，”一家与查尔斯 G 和大卫 H 科赫有关系的保守派团体，繁荣美国人协会主席提姆菲利普说。
       不少家庭都有相似的观念，不管是左倾还是右倾的，都试图从根本上重塑自己的党。超过12个捐款者或家庭成员参与了科赫主办的每年两次的研讨会，他的机构力劝美国商会和其他商业团体将进出口银行排除在外，这些人包括德森夫妻，经纪业的先驱查尔斯施瓦布，以及他的妻子海伦，凯伦布克瓦尔德莱特，他的家族公司生产用来提取和运输天然气的压缩机。
      “大部分参加科赫研讨会的人都是白手起家——他们是自自力更生的人，”德森先生说，他支持取消那些补贴和福利，即使这会让他自己的投资受损。
       另一组家庭，包括对冲基金投资人乔治索罗斯和他的儿子约拿单，与民主党联盟有联系，这是一个推动民主党采取更积极的气候变化立法和更激进的税收法的捐款人关系网。这些捐款者多半来自好莱坞或华尔街，花了数百万美元支持希拉里克林顿。
       这些家庭这么做，一部分是因为与候选人有个人、地区或职业的联系，杰布布什的父亲靠石油发财，布什先生自己在华尔街赚了数百万美元，一些在小捐助者那里很受欢迎的候选人也在佛罗里达和德州的选举办公室服务，这两个州居住着名单上的许多富裕家庭。
       两个捐助者住在佛罗里达印第安溪岛路，按里罗的说法，这是美国最贵的一条街，理查德卡瓦拉瑞（图片来自笔秀网）
       但是捐款也反映了这些最积极利用公民联合会的家庭和商业集团今年面临的政治风险，尤其是能源和金融业的家庭。
       奥巴马政府、国会中的民主党甚至布什先生都在争论税收和监管的改变会迫使许多风投和私募投资公司转向更高水平的合作并接受更高的税率。对冲基金则历史性地受到了轻微的监管，被新的多德弗兰克法案所限制，这是克林顿的夫人希拉里努力捍卫而一些共和党候选人发誓要废除的法案。
       页岩油的开采不但催生了新的财富，也生产了过量的石油，这导致了石油价格的下跌，大部分业内人士希望能放弃长达40年的石油禁运令，这样国内的生产者就有机会接触海外的客户，并且可以使用有争议的吉斯顿式加大号石油管线。
       “除了想要出口石油以外，他们并不指望从政府那儿获得什么，当然大部分人也想要吉斯顿式输油管线，”投资人、天然气倡导者 T. 布恩皮肯斯说到自己的同业们时说。
      “石油和天然气行业为国家创造了奇迹，他们交了大量的税，但是人们还是要攻击你，”皮肯斯先生说，他捐出了12.5万美元给支持布什先生或卡利菲奥瑞拉的团体，“他们是企业家，对所有的事都有自己的意见。”
